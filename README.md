# Bouncing-Ball-using-Python
Ball Bouncing Game: 
This is a simple ball bouncing simulation implemented using the Turtle module in Python.

Description: 
The program simulates a bouncing ball on a black background. The ball moves horizontally with a constant velocity (ball.dx) and experiences a downward acceleration due to gravity (gravity). When the ball hits the bottom of the screen, it bounces back up with a reversed vertical velocity (ball.dy *= -1). Additionally, the ball reverses its horizontal direction when it hits the side walls of the screen.

Features- 
Simple Simulation: The program provides a basic simulation of a bouncing ball. & 
Adjustable Parameters: Users can customize parameters such as initial velocity, gravity, and screen size to modify the behavior of the simulation. & 
Visual Feedback: The ball's movement is displayed visually using the Turtle module. 

Usage- 
Installation: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Run the Program: Execute the Python script (bouncing_ball.py) using your preferred Python interpreter.

Explore the Simulation: Observe the behavior of the bouncing ball as it interacts with the boundaries of the screen.
